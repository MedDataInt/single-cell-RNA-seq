# scRNA-seq
This repository is designed to help beginners learn the fundamental aspects of scRNA-seq, with a focus on both theoretical knowledge and practical applications.

## preparing data for scRNA-seq
h5 file: a type of file format used to store large amounts of data in a hierarchical manner. This makes it easy to store and organize complex datasets. In scRNA-seq, you might have groups for "gene expression", "cell metadata", and "quality control" within the same .h5 file.
convert to h5 file
```r
library(Seurat)
library(here)
# read data as seruat object
```
